# *************Mathematical Foundation
# ---Salar---Scalars are mathematical entities which have only a magnitude(and no direction)---Example----Volume,density,speed,energy,mass, and time
# ---Vector---An array of numbers, which is wither continuous or discrete, is defined as a vector---Example----Force and Velocity, have both magnitude and direction and are called vector
# ---Matrix can be defined as multi-dimentional arrays, which are arranged in the format of rows and columns


# ************ What is Tensor of TensorFlow?
# ----Tensor---A tensor is a mathematical object
# ---Tensor are defined as multidimentional array or list.
# ---Tensor are identifed by the following three parameters.
# ---(1)-Rank:it identifies the number of dimensions of the tensor---Example---Scaler,vector,Matrix
# ---(2)-Shape:Number of rows and columns of Tensor
# ---(3)-Type:Data type assigned to Tensor's elements---Example---Integer,Float,String,Boolean
# ---(4)-Scaler,Arrays or vectors, which are one dimensional, or matrices,Which are two-dimentional.But tensors can be more than two Dimention(Three,four,five dimentional)


# *********What is Flow of Tensorflow?
# ---Flow---Graphical representation of mathematical operation
# ---Everything in TensorFlow is based on designing a computational graph.
# ---The graph has a network of nodes,with each node operating addition,multiplication or evaluation some multivariate equation.
# ---The code is written to build the graph, create a session and execute that graph
# Matrix_A,Matrix_B------>>>Add A&B------->>>>C


# *******What is TensorFlow?
# ----TensorFlow is the core open source library to help youdevelop and train Machine Learning/Deep Learning Models
# ----Develop by Google Brain Team
# ----TensorFlow is Wriiten in Python,C++,CUDA
# ----Platform:Linux,maxOS,Windows,Android,JavaScript
# ----Initial release:November 9,2015
